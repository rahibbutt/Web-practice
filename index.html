            <h1>The Three Little Pigs</h1>
            <p>Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them.
                So
                when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.

                The first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw.
                The
                second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of
                sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.

                The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete
                with a fine fireplace and chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.

                The next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived; and he saw the
                straw
                house, and he smelled the pig inside. He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth
                began
                to water.</p>

            <h1>Jack and the Beanstalk</h1>
            <p>Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack. One day, Jack’s mother told him to sell their
                only cow. Jack
                went to the market and on the way he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. Jack asked, “What will you
                give me
                in return
                for my cow?” The man answered, “I will give you five magic beans!” Jack took the magic beans and gave
                the
                man the cow.
                But when he reached home, Jack’s mother was very angry. She said, “You fool! He took away your cow and
                gave
                you some
                beans!” She threw the beans out of the window. Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner.

                The next day, when Jack woke up in the morning and looked out of the window, he saw that a huge
                beanstalk
                had grown from
                his magic beans! He climbed up the beanstalk and reached a kingdom in the sky. There lived a giant and
                his
                wife. Jack
                went inside the house and found the giant’s wife in the kitchen. Jack said, “Could you please give me
                something to eat?
                I am so hungry!” The kind wife gave him bread and some milk.

                While he was eating, the giant came home. The giant was very big and looked very fearsome. Jack was
                terrified and went
                and hid inside. The giant cried, “Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be
                he
                dead, I’ll
                grind his bones to make my bread!” The wife said, “There is no boy in here!” So, the giant ate his food
                and
                then went to
                his room. He took out his sacks of gold coins, counted them and kept them aside. Then he went to sleep.
                In
                the night,
                Jack crept out of his hiding place, took one sack of gold coins and climbed down the beanstalk. At home,
                he
                gave the
                coins to his mother. His mother was very happy and they lived well for sometime.</p>
